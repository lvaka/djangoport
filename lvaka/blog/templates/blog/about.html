		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>I once woke up in the middle of the night and heard a kitten crying.  I thought nothing of it until the next night I heard the same kitten crying.  My fiance went outside to investigate and we found a little abandoned kitten.  We took her in and she became a part of our family.  My room mate told me that now that I had a cat, I was now officially a developer.</p>
		<p>Okay, well, to be honest I picked up coding a few months earlier as a hobby.  It was a skill I wanted to pick up because I really wanted to join the tech world as I have always had an interest in computer tech and software.  Originally I was playing with the idea of going into project management to play on my strengths as my career in management.  However, I really fell in love with code.  So, I have been spending much of my free time learning new languages and getting familiar with tools of the trade.  Having a new cat is an added bonus to the developer lifestyle.</p>
		<p>I already had a background in HTML 4 and was amazed at how much easier layouts were with HTML 5 and CSS3.  I'm not the greatest designer, but I am confident I can replicate any design given the time.  I also wanted to make my websites do more than just display information so I've been picking up Javasacript and working on learning the Django framework.  Javascript is a bit of necessity, but I picked Python and Django mainly because they have really bad ass names.  Luckily, Python's syntax is amazing to work with and very easy to read.  So it's a win win with the cool name and great language.</p>
		<p>As I've been delving into the backend to get this Django powered site up, I found Windows to be a little inadequate for my needs and picked up Ubuntu to develop on.  Again, Ubuntu sounded sweet, so it was the Linux distro I decided to get.  That, and I really didn't have it in my budget to get a Mac.  Free is very affordable.</p>
		<p>My future plans are to learn framework for Flask and eventually dip my toes into PHP and Laravel.  I'm also debating whether or not to pick up Angular or React to supplement my Javascript once I have a solid foundation</p>
